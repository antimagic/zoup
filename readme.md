# Zoup

## Build
`yarn && yarn build` will grab all the dependencies and build the project.

See releases for a precompiled copy.

## Usage
Once built, navigate to the project in your VM or just open the `index.html` directly in a browser.

## Notes
- As Zomato's public API doesn't appear to expose phone numbers or opening hours, I've substituted a link to the restaurant's Zomato profile.
